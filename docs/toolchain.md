# Installing Software On Your Home Computer

## Unity

Unity can be installed on any reasonably modern computer running Linux, macOS, or Windows. I've heard reports of people succussfully installing Unity on a ChromeBook (which is running Linux "under the covers"), but I don't have a ChromeBook to test on. The restrictions on SKSD ChromeBooks will probably make installing Unity impossible for now (as of 9 Apr 2020).

Do not install Unity directly, instead instal Unity Hub and use it to manage your Unity installs.

Instructions:

* [Linux (not ChromeBook), macOS, and Windows](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) â€“ download and install Unity Hub **not** Unity itself. Once you have Unity Hub installed, use it to install Unity. Install version **2018.4 (LTS)** for Create with Code.
* [ChromeBook]()
