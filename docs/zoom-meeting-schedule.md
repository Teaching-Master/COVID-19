# General Meeting Information

In the strange new world of Zoombombing we've had to step up meeting security, here's the new routine:
1. Meetings require a password – the passwords for our class meetings are embedded in the links below, please don't share them.
1. When you join a class meeting, you'll be put into the Zoom "waiting room." As soon as I recognize you, I'll add you into the class. So…
1. Please be sure that you set your name in Zoom to your full name (we have quite a few students who share a first name).
